The digital transformation of any organization must include cybersecurity issues, without compliance with the requirements of which it is impossible to build a reliable information system. Today, many existing software products, security tools and IT systems do not meet the new conditions in which they will have to perform their functions. After the departure of foreign software suppliers, the President of Russia decided to develop an import substitution program and set a deadline for the transition to domestic security tools until January 1, 2025. In particular, a ban was introduced on the use of any foreign software at critical information infrastructure facilities in Russia. Due to the current geopolitical situation and the modern picture of cyber threats, it is necessary to develop our own solutions in the field of information security. Sberbank is actively engaged in import substitution of information security tools using innovative technologies. The bank successfully overcomes its dependence on Western suppliers and Western models and methods, changes outdated approaches to risk assessment and management, which helps to effectively solve the problems of replacing cybersecurity tools both for current tasks and for working in conditions of increasing cyber aggression.
