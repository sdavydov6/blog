Artificial intelligence-based technologies are becoming increasingly popular in medicine and healthcare. Experts already highly value the potential of neural networks: from the ability to accurately diagnose serious diseases (for example, coronary heart disease) to the development of new drugs and generics.
The role of AI in healthcare is growing more and more actively. According to CB Insights, in 2021, funding for this sector worldwide increased by 108%. The volume of the Russian medical technology market at the end of 2022 amounted to 19.46 billion rubles, an increase of 27.71% compared to the previous year. According to estimates by the National Center for Artificial Intelligence Development (NCAI), today more than half of AI technologies in the field of healthcare are at the experimental launch stage.
Three areas related to computer diagnostics are developing most successfully: screening and deeper analysis of symptoms based on the study of medical images, for example, X-rays or CT scans, support for medical decision-making, and automation of routine work. For example, a voice bot will help you fill out medical records, and robot operators will make appointments for patients.
