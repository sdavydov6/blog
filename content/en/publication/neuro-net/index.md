Neural networks are the brains of artificial intelligence. They are made up of neurons that process information and pass it on to each other. A neuron has connections with other neurons and learns to recognize patterns in data. Neural networks are trained by feeding them a large amount of data, such as input and expected output information.

The neural network adapts and changes its weights and parameters to minimize the error between the predicted and actual output. Neural networks can learn to recognize images, voices, texts and make decisions based on this data. They are used in various fields such as medicine, finance, the automotive industry, entertainment and everyday life. Neural networks are a cool thing that helps make our world a better and smarter place.

Training neural networks is a dive into the depths of wisdom and knowledge. The process where a neuron, like a student in front of a teacher, learns to recognize images, understand texts and make decisions. Neural networks learn from vast amounts of data, a drop of information is new knowledge, a new revelation.

And like magic, neural networks are used to teach artificial intelligence, transferring their knowledge to machines, giving them the ability to think, understand, analyze. They become the key that unlocks the doors to a world of new possibilities, a world where a machine becomes a thinking being, capable of solving problems and creating unprecedented miracles.
