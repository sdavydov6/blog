# Summary for listings and search engines

summary: Scientific programming is a field where computational power and mathematical rigor come together to solve complex problems in science, engineering, and research. In this context, the choice of programming language plays a key role, as it affects not only performance, but also ease of development, availability of libraries and communities, and compatibility with existing tools. Let's look at the main languages ​​that are most often used in scientific computing and research.

Quantum computing is a reality, but it is still far from being used regularly in industry. The pace of quantum computing advancement depends on the number of specialists who can make a real contribution to its development. And here it is necessary to create, develop and support teams of physicists who are building new material embodiments for managing quantum effects. In addition, groups of programmers and mathematicians who are developing software for quantum computing and their harmonious combination with the world of classical computing need support. Targeted work is needed to find and stimulate specialists in applied areas who could translate problems from their area into the language of quantum representations. I will add that Artezio has opened an artificial intelligence laboratory, and we are paying attention to QML.
